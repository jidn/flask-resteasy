# Flask-RESTeasy
Create easy REST APIs with Flask

It starts with an itch.  I was using Flask-RESTful but started running
into areas where the framework keep getting in the way: error handling,
scope creep.  I just wanted something to easy routing and plumbing for
REST APIs, leaving the frosting out so I can use which ever validator
I want

I wanted something simple in the way Flask was simple.  This is my
attempt at making it so.
